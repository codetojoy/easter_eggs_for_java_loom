### easter_eggs_for_java_loom

- some basic examples for Project Loom, which is preview in JDK 19 (as of 17-MAY-2022) 
- usage of *egg* here is intended as an [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/); **not** a [hidden feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media))

### Notes

* examples for [structured concurrency](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/428) do not use JDK 19 (preview) but a Loom-specific build
    - see README for each example
