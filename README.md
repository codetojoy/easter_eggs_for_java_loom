### easter_eggs_for_java_loom

- examples re: [Project Loom](https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/) in JDK 19
- usage of *egg* here is intended as an [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/); **not** a [hidden feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media))

### Notes

* includes examples for [virtual threads](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425), a "preview" feature in JDK 19
* includes examples for [structured concurrency](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/428), which is "incubator" in JDK 19 
    - we use `sc` for "structured concurrency" in the folder names
* see README for each example
