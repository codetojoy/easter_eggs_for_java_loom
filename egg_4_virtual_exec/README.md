Summary:
---------

* this egg illustrates virtual threads via ExecutorService
    - it acts like a thread-pool but it is just a facade for the familiar API
* this egg uses:
    - Java 19 (preview) virtual threads

To Build:
---------

* tested with [this JDK](../jdk.md)
* Gradle does not yet support JDK 19 preview (as of JUN 2022). Check [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)
* unknown if Maven can be used ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

useful commands:

* `set env`
    - SDKMan! will set JDK to value in `.sdkmanrc`
* `./clean.sh`
* `./compile.sh`
* `./run.sh`
* note `./go.sh` is useful for clean-compile-run cycle


Flight Recorder:
----------------

* use `./run_with_flight_recorder.sh` to generate `flight.jfr`
* install Java Mission Control 8.1.0 from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/jmc.html)
* in terminal, run: `open JDK\ Mission\ Control.app/`
* in app, open `flight.jfr`
