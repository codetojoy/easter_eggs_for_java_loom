Summary:
---------

* this egg illustrates structured concurrency

To Build:
---------

* requires JDK 19.ea.5.lm-open via [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/)
    - this is a special build for Project Loom, *not* the JDK 19 preview
* Gradle does not yet support JDK 19 preview (as of MAY 2022). Check [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html)
* unknown if Maven can be used ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

useful commands:

* `./clean.sh`
* `./compile.sh`
* `./run.sh`
* note `./go.sh` does all of the above
